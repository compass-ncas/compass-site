		<h2>The Challenge</h2>
		<p>For bigger spacecraft capable of executing bigger missions,
		some of the assembly may be done in space.<br>
		Your challenge is to design a simple approach that enables components to be assembled in space.

		We are Nalanda College Astronomical Society members. We join this opportunity as we are interested in gain experiences in the astronomical research field, which is the key to a modern world by valuable ideas from all over the world. In competition, some challenges enable solutions for space assembly. From those, we selected the title, Letâ€™s Connect, with the challenge of space assembling. Because space assembling; is an essential matter in space explorations. In here, our conception is to invent
		a new docking mechanism for active and passive vehicles. As an example, the docking process between a spacecraft and ISS (International Space Station). This conception was named, Universal Docking System (UDS). This concept represents a low cost and effortless approach for docking and mainly initiated from four arms fixed to the passive vehicle. From this, we assume, the time elapsed, for the docking process, will be reduced significantly. Also, staff can dock the active to the passive, easily
		than previous standard international docking system by neglecting some factors that considered for the initial method. We include essential measurements, materials, 3D figures and etcetera in our main document.			<br>Thank You!

		<h2>Importance of this project and what we have done</h2>
		<p>
		We have developed a Universal Docking System which can be used by any spacecraft. Unlike other docking systems our docking system consist arms to hold the other spaceship. Usually when docking all errors should be less than 0.2. Therefore it takes more time to align the spaceship to the docking interface. But in our design docking can be done with comparatively wider range of error. The tilt angle doesn't matter at all. Therefore the whole docking process can be done within a less time. With the time, the number of space missions increase. Therefore in the future more docking and undocking will happen in the space. Therefore we need to do this process within less time than rather than spending hours. We hope that our project and design will serve a great support for that.

		<h2>Our objectives</h2>
		<p align="left" style="margin-left:100px;">
			1.Making a secure connection between spaceships.<br>
			2.Fast and efficient docking process.<br>
			3.Less work need to be done for the pre-docking rendezvous phase.<br>
			4.Higher accuracy.<br>
			5.Ease of use.<br>
			6.Can work even when there's a problem in the soft capture system of the passive object (Emergency scenario)
