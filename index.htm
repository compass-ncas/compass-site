		Your challenge is to design a simple approach that enables components to be assembled in space.

			We are Nalanda College Astronomical Society members and we join this opportunity as we are interested in gain experiences on astronomical research  side. This is a key to a modern world by valuable ideas from all over the world. In competition, there is some challenges that enable solutions for space connect. From those, we selected the ‘Let’s Connect’ topic, with the challenge of space assembling. Because it’s a more essential matter in space explorations. Under this topic, our conception is to invent a new docking mechanism for active and passive vehicles, as an example, the docking between a space craft and <br>ISS(International Space Station). This conception is named as Universal Docking System(UDS).This concept is present a low cost and easy method for docking and this is mainly initiated from four arms fixed to passive vehicle. From this, we think, the time elapsed for docking is reduced and staff can dock the active to the passive, easily than previous standard international docking system by neglect some factors, that considered for previous method. We are include essential measurements, materials, 3D figures, etc. in our main document.
			<br>Thank You!
